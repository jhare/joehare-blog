I've been noticing a number of fonts that I like lately. They're pretty common
and you probably know about them already, but this is it

  * Lato
  * Proxima Nova
  * Open Sans

And more to come...

They're all offered by Google Fonts right now. Hoping to expand this list of
fonts so I can categorize them the way Practical Typography does so I have a
quick list to pick from when I'm making design decisions.
