New generators that I'm working on now

  * Travis-CI integration generator [generator-travis-ci-integration](https://github.com/jhare/generator-travis-ci-integration)
  * Github repo creation generator [generator-github-integration](https://github.com/jhare/generator-github-integration)
  * CodeClimate integration generator [generator-codeclimate-integration](https://github.com/jhare/generator-codeclimate-integration)

Later on...
  * Bitbucket repo creation generator
  * Github pages creation
  * ... and more?

There are a few generators that overlap with mine, but they do not work in a generic enough way.  Some are unmaintained, others try to do collections of these tasks in one generator when really they should be broken up.
